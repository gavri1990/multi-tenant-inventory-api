# Multi-Tenant Inventory API

A modern REST API project showcasing **cloud-native development** with **multi-tenant architecture**, **role-based access control**, and **JWT authentication**. The goal is to demonstrate scalable design patterns and deployment practices using **Azure hosting**, **Docker**, and a CI/CD pipeline.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This project is under active development. The database schema has been completed (see diagram below), while API endpoints, authentication, and deployment scripts are still being implemented.

## 📌 Features (Planned & In Progress)
- Multi-tenant architecture for secure data isolation  
- Role-based access control  
- JWT authentication for stateless security  
- RESTful API design following modern best practices  
- Deployment to Azure hosting with Docker containerization  
- CI/CD pipeline integration
